# Haskell split and sum

## Liability

This program was a university assignment. No guarantee of correctness.

## Run

### Haskell Compiler (ghc)
```bash
ghc CalculationFinder.hs
```

This will compile and output the CaluclationFinder programm which you can execute by invoking ./CalculationFinder

### Haskell Interpreter (ghci)
```bash
ghci CalculationFinder.hs
```

Then you can either run the main function or call the findCalculation directly.
